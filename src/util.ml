(* NOTE(dbp 2015-01-26): Shapes that just have primitive types
   (boolean, integer, etc) types aren't actually useful (they
   communicate no information, since all of the typing is
   structural). Some string types are `enums`, which we support by translating
   them into actual types, but non-enum string shapes are similarly not
   useful. So, we will both remove references to them in fields (by
   just replacing them with Integer, Boolean, etc), and removing the
   shapes themselves.

   NOTE(dbp 2015-02-04): Another optimization: get rid of structs with no fields.
   Many of these are actually error descriptions, but once we support those, they
   would get parsed before this pass (similarly to how enums don't get inlined
   away as strings).
